# Enhanced Document Generator Logger Fix

## Problem Identified
The enhanced_document_generator_fixed.py file was using a logger variable that was not defined, causing the error:
"Error creating PDFs: name 'logger' is not defined"

## Root Cause
The [enhanced_document_generator_fixed.py](file://c:\Users\Rajkumar\BillGeneratorV01\enhanced_document_generator_fixed.py) file was using a logger in multiple places but did not have it imported or defined:
- Line 369: `logger.error(f"Playwright PDF generation error: {str(e)}")`
- Line 556: `logger.warning(f"Generated PDF too small: {doc_name} ({len(pdf_bytes)} bytes)")`
- Line 562: `logger.error(f"Error creating PDF for {doc_name}: {str(e)}")`
- Line 576: `logger.error(f"Error in PDF creation process: {str(e)}")`

## Solution Implemented

### Added Logger Import and Definition
Added the following lines at the top of [enhanced_document_generator_fixed.py](file://c:\Users\Rajkumar\BillGeneratorV01\enhanced_document_generator_fixed.py):

```python
import logging

# Configure logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

## Files Modified
1. [enhanced_document_generator_fixed.py](file://c:\Users\Rajkumar\BillGeneratorV01\enhanced_document_generator_fixed.py) - Added logger import and definition

## Testing
The application has been successfully tested and is now:
✅ Running on port 8503
✅ Generating HTML documents without errors
✅ Creating PDF files successfully
✅ Ready for deployment

## Additional Notes
- The logger is now properly configured for the EnhancedDocumentGenerator class
- Error messages will now be properly logged instead of causing exceptions
- This fix resolves the PDF generation issue that was preventing the application from creating PDF files
