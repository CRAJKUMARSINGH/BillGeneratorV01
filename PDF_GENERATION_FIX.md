# PDF Generation Issue Resolution

## Problem Identified
The deployable Streamlit application was unable to create PDF files, showing the error:
"Error creating PDFs: name 'logger' is not defined"

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by two problems:
1. The `logger` variable was being used in the PDF generation code but was not defined in the deployable_app.py file
2. The application was trying to use port 8501 which was already in use

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Logger Definition Fix
Added proper logger configuration to deployable_app.py:
```python
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

### 2. Error Handling Improvement
Enhanced the error handling in the create_pdf_documents function to provide better error messages:
```python
except Exception as e:
    st.error(f"Error creating PDFs: {str(e)}")
    import traceback
    st.error(f"Traceback: {traceback.format_exc()}")
    return None
```

### 3. Port Conflict Resolution
Configured the application to run on port 8502 to avoid conflicts:
```bash
streamlit run deployable_app.py --server.port 8502
```

## Files Modified
1. deployable_app.py - Added logger configuration and improved error handling

## Testing
The application has been successfully tested and is now:
✅ Running on port 8502
✅ Generating HTML documents without errors
✅ Creating PDF files successfully
✅ Ready for deployment

## Deployment Instructions
To deploy the application:
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed from requirements-deploy.txt
2. Run the application with: `streamlit run deployable_app.py --server.port 8502`
3. Access the application at http://0.0.0.0:8502

## Additional Notes
- The PDF generation now uses ReportLab for reliable PDF creation
- Error handling has been improved to provide detailed error messages
- Memory optimization techniques are in place for handling large datasets
