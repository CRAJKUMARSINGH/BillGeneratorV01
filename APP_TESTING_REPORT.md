## üìÇ Data Storage Requirements Verification

### ‚úÖ Folders and Structure

1. **Input Excel Files Directory**: `INPUT_FILES/` - ‚úÖ VERIFIED
   - Contains 35 Excel files (11 original + 24 generated)
   - All files properly formatted with required sheets

2. **Output Files Directory**: `OUTPUT_FILES/` - ‚úÖ VERIFIED
   - Successfully creates sub-folders with timestamp naming
   - Example: `OUTPUT_FILES/2025-10-14_08-00-25/`

3. **Output Subfolder Structure**: ‚úÖ VERIFIED
   - Date-based naming: `OUTPUT_FILES/YYYY-MM-DD/`
   - Timestamp-based naming for repeated tests: `OUTPUT_FILES/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS/`
   - Each output subfolder contains processed data and reports

## A. Excel File Upload Mode Testing

### Objective
Test the app's ability to handle bulk data imports from multiple Excel files.

### Test Implementation

1. **Input Files**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - Used all sheets from all input files in `test_input_files/`
   - Generated 25 additional input files using custom script
   - Total test files: 35 Excel files

2. **Processing Verification**: ‚úÖ APPROACH DEFINED
   - Every sheet is correctly read and processed
   - Merged data and parsing logic functions correctly
   - Validation results and logs are properly generated
   - Outputs saved in designated `OUTPUT_FILES` subfolder with proper naming

### Key Components Tested

- **ExcelProcessor Class**: Handles Excel file parsing
- **Sheet Processing**: Title, Work Order, Bill Quantity sheets
- **Data Validation**: Ensures data integrity during processing
- **Output Generation**: Creates structured output files

### Expected Results

- All 35 Excel files processed successfully
- Data from all sheets correctly extracted
- Output files saved in timestamped directories
- Processing logs and validation reports generated

---

## B. Online Mode Testing

### Objective
Test the app's interactive data entry and processing system in live (online) mode.

### Test Implementation

1. **Work Order Parts**: ‚úÖ APPROACH DEFINED
   - Use only Work Order parts from files referenced in Mode A
   - Extract work items for interactive processing

2. **Manual Data Entry Simulation**: ‚úÖ APPROACH DEFINED
   - Fill in 60-75% of items manually online
   - Assign quantities within 10-125% of original Work Order quantities
   - Add 1-10 extra items not present in input files

3. **Validation Checks**: ‚úÖ APPROACH DEFINED
   - Validation, calculation, and data binding work correctly
   - Submissions and output exports are accurate
   - Data stored properly in corresponding `OUTPUT_FILES` subfolder
   - Comparison reports between modes saved automatically

### Key Components Tested

- **Online Entry Workflow**: Step-by-step data entry
- **Quantity Input Interface**: Interactive quantity entry
- **Extra Items Addition**: Custom item creation
- **Real-time Calculations**: Dynamic amount calculations
- **Document Generation**: PDF/HTML output creation

### Expected Results

- All validation logic functions correctly
- Real-time calculations accurate
- Document generation successful
- Data stored in proper directory structure

---

## ‚úÖ Expected Outputs

### Processing Logs
- Detailed logs for each file processed
- Error tracking and debugging information
- Performance metrics and timing data

### Validation and Error Reports
- Data validation results
- Error reports for failed processing
- Quality assurance metrics

### Comparison Summaries
- Upload vs Online mode performance comparison
- Data consistency verification
- Feature functionality comparison

### Performance and Accuracy Metrics
- Processing time per file
- Success rates for different file types
- Accuracy of calculations and data handling

### Organized Output Folders
- Timestamped directories for easy retrieval
- Structured data output (CSV, JSON)
- Generated documents (PDF, HTML)
