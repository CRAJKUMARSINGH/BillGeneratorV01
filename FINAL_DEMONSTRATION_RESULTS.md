### Zero Rate Handling Validation

The application correctly implements the VBA specification for zero rate handling:

#### For Zero Rate Items (Item 09 in example):
- Only Serial Number (Column D) and Description (Column E) are populated
- All other columns remain blank as required
- Amount correctly calculated as ₹0.00

#### For Non-Zero Rate Items:
- All appropriate columns are populated with data
- Calculations are performed correctly with proper rounding
- Amounts match quantity × rate calculations

### File Processing Workflow Verification

#### Excel Upload Mode
✅ **Batch Processing**: Multiple Excel files processed simultaneously
✅ **Data Extraction**: Automatic extraction from Title, Work Order, and Bill Quantity sheets
✅ **Validation**: Built-in data validation and error handling
✅ **Output Generation**: Structured CSV files for each data type
✅ **Reporting**: Comprehensive processing reports

#### Online Mode with Auto Quantity Assignment
✅ **Interactive Workflow**: Step-by-step user-guided process
✅ **Work Order Loading**: Initial data loading from Excel files
✅ **Auto Quantity Assignment**: 60-75% of items automatically assigned quantities
✅ **Extra Items**: Addition of supplementary work items
✅ **Real-time Calculation**: Dynamic total calculation
✅ **Output Generation**: CSV files and JSON summary

### Performance Metrics

#### Processing Speed
- **Excel Upload Mode**: Sub-second per file processing
- **Online Mode**: Real-time response for user interactions

#### Resource Usage
