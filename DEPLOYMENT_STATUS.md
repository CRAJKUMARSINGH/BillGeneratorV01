# Deployment Status

## Current Status: âœ… SUCCESS

The Streamlit application has been successfully configured for deployment with the following components:

## Configuration Files Added

1. **Procfile** - Specifies the command to run the application on deployment platforms
2. **runtime.txt** - Specifies the Python version (3.11.9) for compatibility
3. **setup.py** - Package configuration for proper installation
4. **.streamlit/config.toml** - Streamlit configuration for deployment
5. **Updated README.md** - Documentation for deployment instructions

## Requirements Fixed

- Resolved dependency conflicts in requirements-deploy.txt
- Streamlit version pinned to 1.28.0 for compatibility
- Updated python-dateutil to >=2.8.2 to satisfy both pandas and streamlit requirements
- Fixed rich version to 13.7.1 to avoid conflicts with streamlit

## Git Repository Status

- All deployment configuration files have been committed and pushed to the remote repository
- Remote repository: https://github.com/CRAJKUMARSINGH/BillGeneratorV01.git

## Local Testing

- Application successfully runs on http://0.0.0.0:8501
- Deployable app (deployable_app.py) loads without errors
- All required dependencies are installed and compatible

## Deployment Readiness

The application is now ready for deployment to:
- Streamlit Cloud
- Heroku
- Other cloud platforms supporting Python applications

## Next Steps

1. Connect the GitHub repository to your preferred deployment platform
2. Select `deployable_app.py` as the main file for deployment
3. Deploy the application
4. Test the deployed version with sample Excel files

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during deployment:

1. Ensure all configuration files are in the repository
2. Check that requirements-deploy.txt is being used instead of requirements.txt
3. Verify the Python version is compatible with your deployment platform
4. Confirm that the Procfile specifies the correct entry point
