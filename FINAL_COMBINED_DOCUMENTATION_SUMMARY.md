### Removed Files
- Empty or redundant report.md files from output directories
- Duplicate backup files with identical content
- Temporary files generated during testing

## Future Maintenance Guidelines

1. **Documentation Updates**: Update this combined document when adding new features
2. **Template Changes**: Document template modifications in the implementation section
3. **Test Additions**: Maintain separate test documentation in test_suite directory
4. **Periodic Cleanup**: Run cleanup scripts periodically to maintain organization

## Conclusion

The consolidation of markdown documentation has successfully streamlined the project's information architecture while preserving all essential details. The combined documentation provides a comprehensive yet organized view of the Bill Generator project, making it easier for developers and users to understand and work with the system.
