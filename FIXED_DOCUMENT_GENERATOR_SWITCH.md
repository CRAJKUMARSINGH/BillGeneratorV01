# PDF Generation Fix - Switch to FixedDocumentGenerator

## Problem Identified
The deployable Streamlit application was unable to create PDF files, showing the error:
"⚠️ Could not create PDF files"

## Root Cause
The application was using EnhancedDocumentGenerator which has complex async PDF generation that was not working properly in the Streamlit deployment environment.

## Solution Implemented

### Switched to FixedDocumentGenerator
Changed the deployable_app.py to use FixedDocumentGenerator instead of EnhancedDocumentGenerator:

1. Updated imports:
```python
# Changed from:
from enhanced_document_generator_fixed import EnhancedDocumentGenerator
# To:
from fixed_document_generator import FixedDocumentGenerator
```

2. Updated document generation functions to use FixedDocumentGenerator:
```python
def generate_documents(data):
    """Generate documents from processed data"""
    try:
        # Generate documents
        generator = FixedDocumentGenerator(data)
        documents = generator.generate_all_documents()
        return documents
    except Exception as e:
        st.error(f"Error generating documents: {str(e)}")
        return None

def create_pdf_documents(documents):
    """Create PDF documents from HTML"""
    try:
        generator = FixedDocumentGenerator({})  # Empty data for PDF generation
        pdf_files = generator.create_pdf_documents(documents)
        return pdf_files
    except Exception as e:
        st.error(f"Error creating PDFs: {str(e)}")
        import traceback
        st.error(f"Traceback: {traceback.format_exc()}")
        return None
```

## Benefits of This Change

1. **Reliable PDF Generation**: FixedDocumentGenerator uses ReportLab directly, which is more reliable than the async approach
2. **Simpler Implementation**: Less complex code with fewer dependencies
3. **Better Error Handling**: More straightforward error messages and handling
4. **Memory Efficient**: Better memory management for large documents

## Files Modified
1. deployable_app.py - Switched from EnhancedDocumentGenerator to FixedDocumentGenerator

## Testing
The application has been successfully tested and is now:
✅ Running on port 8504
✅ Generating HTML documents without errors
✅ Creating PDF files successfully using ReportLab
✅ Ready for deployment

## Additional Notes
- This change aligns with the best practice of prioritizing ReportLab over WeasyPrint for PDF generation
- The FixedDocumentGenerator provides a more stable and reliable PDF generation process
- Template rendering issues are handled with fallback to programmatic generation
