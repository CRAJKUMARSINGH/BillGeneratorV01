# Fix Summary

## Issue
The application was failing to start due to import errors:
1. The `app.py` file was trying to import `EnhancedDocumentGenerator` from `enhanced_document_generator_fixed.py`
2. However, the class in `enhanced_document_generator_fixed.py` had been renamed from `EnhancedDocumentGenerator` to `DocumentGenerator`
3. This caused a runtime error when Streamlit tried to run the application

## Root Cause
In a recent commit (215e6bd), the class name was changed from `EnhancedDocumentGenerator` to `DocumentGenerator` but:
1. The import statements in `app.py` were not updated
2. Some method calls were still referencing the old class name
3. Two important methods (`generate_all_formats_and_zip` and `save_all_formats`) were removed from the class

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Import Statements in `app.py`
- Updated import statements to use `DocumentGenerator` instead of `EnhancedDocumentGenerator`
- Updated all instances where `EnhancedDocumentGenerator` was being instantiated to use `DocumentGenerator`

### 2. Restored Missing Methods in `enhanced_document_generator_fixed.py`
- Added back the `generate_all_formats_and_zip` method that creates HTML, PDF, DOC documents and ZIP package
- Added back the `save_all_formats` method that saves all document formats to individual files

### 3. Fixed Class Name Consistency
- Ensured all references to the document generator class use the correct name (`DocumentGenerator`)

## Verification
- Both `app.py` and `enhanced_document_generator_fixed.py` now compile without syntax errors
- Import statements work correctly
- The application should now start without the import error

## Files Modified
1. `app.py` - Updated import statements and class instantiations
2. `enhanced_document_generator_fixed.py` - Restored missing methods

The application should now run correctly without the import error.
